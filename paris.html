								<h4>Dec 29th</h4>
									<p>We arrived at Paris ORY Airport at around 1pm and then we hopped on the train that takes you to the actual city. While leaving the train station at Gare Du Nord Emily's phone got stolen while waiting to go through to the turnstile. After sorting that out and finally getting wifi on my phone we checked into our Airbnb and holed up for a few hours while we processed what just happened. We then had a little power nap in the Airbnb and woke up around 8pm local time. We then found an American hostel bar where we could watch the Clemson vs. Notre Dame college football playoff semi-final. After that game had ended, we walked back to our Airbnb and watched the first half of the Alabama vs. Oklahoma game and then we fell asleep.</p>

								<h4>Dec 30th</h4>
									<p>Em and I woke up around 10am and took our time getting ready. We then took the metro towards to Louvre to get some breakfast and do some site-seeing. We walked all around the Louvre but decided not to go inside because of the price and the long line. We came to regret this decision after the trip ended. After the Louvre, we walked to the Arc de Triomphe. We also skipped walking to the top of the Arc; the line was long and we heard that it was not particularly worth it. We then walked to a place near by called Cafe Belloy and got some pizza for a late lunch. We left the cafe and found a small grocery store and bought a bottle of wine, a baguette and some prosciutto. We ended our day by sitting on a bench under the Eiffel Tower with our tasty treats.</p>

								<h4>Dec 31st</h4>
									<p>We slept in until 9am ish and then walked to a nearby cafe to get some croissants and coffee. We walked with our breakfast down to the canals. It was a cold and cloudy day so there were not many people out and about, but it made our walk nice and peaceful.</p>
