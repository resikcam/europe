This project is meant to be a summary of our month long trip to Europe spanning from December 2018 to the end of January 2019. The trip is broken up by each city/region that we visited. Each page has brief descriptions and images of what we did in each city.

This project is still a work in progress so any demo images* or text is to be ignored for now.
